Add all files not in Example and ServerSide into the Ext.ux folder (typically ExtHome/examples/ux) in a folder called exporter.
Add the files in ServerSide into an appropriate location for your application.

For an example of the Exporter in use see the example folder.

The key things needed are:
 - a hidden iframe in the main html page that can be referenced when the download needs to be initiated
 - the path to Ext.ux.exporter set correctly in the loader
 - add Ext.ux.exporter.Exporter to the list of required files for your application
 - a button with a handler that will extract the data from a grid / store using Exporter, save it as a temp file, and then download this temp file
